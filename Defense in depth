CIA -> Confidentiality + Integrity + Availability
Confidentiality -> principle of least principle
Integrity -> Prevention unauthorized changes to data at rest and in-transit
Availability -> Services Availability, DDoS protection, HA and DR

Physical Security -> Microsoft building and hardware security
Identity and Access -> Authenticate (who)/ Authorize(what you can do), Audit changes
Perimeter -> DDoS attacks protection, Firewalls at the perimeter
Network -> Limit communication, Deny by default, restrict inboud internet access and limit outbound, allow only whats required, NSGs
Compute -> Updates, Endpoint protection,  access to OS
Application  -> Ensure apps are secure, store secrets to Key vault
Data -> Disk encryption and Encrypted in transit

Compliance and Security requirements

Shared responsibility model - itâ€™s a joint responsibility between Cloud Provider and Cloud Customer
Responsivity Shifts towards Cloud providers as we go IaaS -> PaaS -> SaaS

Zero trust principle -> Identities, Devices, Applications, Data, Infra, Network

You are always responsible
Data, Endpoints, Accounts, Access Management

Microsoft Trust center -> audits, whitepapers, security assessments, compliance and privacy for all Cloud Services 
Service Trust - Docs
Compliance manager -> provides insights and actions and prepare compliance reports
Blueprints -> Help achieve compliance
