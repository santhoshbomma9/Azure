Azure AD Directory + Subscription - trust relationship
	 AD can have multiple subscriptions but each subscription is assigned to only one Directory
	Can move subscriptions across tenants but a little complex process 
Add Role assignments for User to  Azure resources 

Enterprise Identity Solution (Azure AD Connect)
Single Sign-on
MFA
Self-service password reset
 
License Free, O365, P1 and P2
To avoid single point of failure on comms between azure and on prem, implement a dc in azure through vpn gateway
 

User 
Groups
Roles (Directory(global admin and etc) vs Resource(RBAC roles))
Implementing as 4 stage https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-admin-roles-secure

App registration (application objects in tenant - global representation of your application - a service principle is created in every tenant its accessed)
Enterprise Apps (list and manage service principles in your tenant, is a concreate instance which is local representation/app instance of global application object)

App object - many service-principle in different tenants

MFA - something you know, something you are and something you have.  Text, Call, App, App-code, Third-party tokens
Service principle - Use app registration to create service prinple
	Role assignment can combine a service principle(user/service) and

Devices
Customer Domains

External Identities (B2B adding guest users, Azure AD multitenant apps, Azure AD B2C)
Identity Governance 
	Automate and create access reviews
	PIM -> JIT VM, scheduled access/role assignments, alerts and approval
	Roles 
	(Azure AD roles and Resource(RBAC) roles)
	(Permanent, Eligible - can request)
	
Security 
	Identity protection, 
	MFA policies and 
	risk policies and risk events, conditional policies
	
Mobility (MDM and MAM) -> Intune for devices
Password Reset -> Self serve password reset
Application proxy -> to connect on-prem apps from outside your corp network

Azure AD Connect
	AD DS Sync services -> users and groups 
		Filtering (can filter what can filter)
		Authentication:
			Password hash sync - sync password hash (saved hash in Azure)
			Pass-through - Authentication request are passed to on-prem
		Password write back - change password in cloud and it will write back 
		Device write-back 
		Prevent accidental deletes
		Automatic upgrade
	AD FS(optional) -> domain joined SSO, thirds party MFA
		Federated Authentication pass the password validation to on-prem ADFS
	Health monitoring
		Download AD Connect Health Agent -> send notifications to Global admins

	Cloud Authentication
		Cloud only
		Password Hash Sync + Seamless SSO (less effort)
		Pass-through +Seamless SSO (more effort, must have access to on-prem, can have hash sync as backup)
	
	Federation Authentication
		AD FS ( Azure AD <-> ADDS <-> ADFS)
		3rd Part Federation providers
	
	SSO - Single sign On
		If logged in with AD DS credentials, users no longer need to login again as the browser knows
