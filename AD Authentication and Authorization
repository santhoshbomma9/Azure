Authentication
---------------------
Kerboros -> Ticketing based system between client -----tgt--> Ticket distriburtion cetner (dc) -> Server
  password is not send, but a packet is encrypted with password and sent
  if the packet is decrypted by the dc, then it will grant tickets to requested resource
NTLM
  -> User challenge resonse authentication
  -> Why use this instead of Kerberos
        ->When Kerberos is not supported NTML is next best option , like
            -> client is authentication by ip address instead of domain name
            -> if no Kerberos trust between two forests
            -> One or both computers are not in domain
            -> If Kerberos ports are blocked by Firewall
Certificates
  -> public private keys
SmartCards (mfa)
  -> uses certificates
  -> comes with MFA
Biometrics
  -> Finger print or eye scan
